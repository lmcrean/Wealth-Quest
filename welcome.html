                                    The purpose of #game name# is to create a passive income that is greater than your
                                    total
                                    expenses.
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>Goal = passive income > total expenses</strong> <br />
                                    You can get an idea of how far you are from achieving this by looking at your goal
                                    tracker,
                                    displayed
                                    in your financial statement and on the main screen. It’s not that simple though… the
                                    goal
                                    will change
                                    depending on your total expenses. So to win you will have to keep your expenses down
                                    and
                                    your passive
                                    income flowing in!

                                If you land on a DEAL or LIFE card, you could get the opportunity to gain an asset that
                                provides
                                a
                                positive cash flow. An example could be a property that you invest in. If that property
                                is
                                rented out,
                                you could get passive income without doing any extra work! How nice. Be careful though,
                                each
                                opportunity
                                should be carefully considered as they don’t all provide the same benefits. Some may
                                provide you
                                with
                                quick cash, while some may be slow burners which slowly push you towards your goal. So
                                keep a
                                close eye
                                on your financial statement so you can make well calculated decisions.

                                Expenses are what you pay out at payday. They are determined by your liabilities which
                                you can
                                pay-off
                                or accumulate throughout the game. Your aim is to pay off your liabilities so that your
                                expenses
                                are
                                less! This means you don’t need so much passive income to win the game. <br />
                                As an example, you have a home mortgage of £38000 to pay off. You pay £400 every pay day
                                towards
                                your
                                mortgage until your mortgage is £0. Maybe you get lucky with some stocks (... I mean
                                skillful)
                                and earn
                                lots of cash; this might be a good time to make a bulk payment to your mortgage.
                            </p>
